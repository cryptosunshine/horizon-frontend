          HORIZON is committed to creating a system where users, through staking and active participation, can receive rewards and contributions from various platforms. Our model encourages fairness and long-term commitment while fostering a community-driven ecosystem of rewards.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            Users can stake WBTC tokens into our smart contract for a period between 1 and 30 years. For every day of staking, users earn an equity score of 1 WBTC * 1 day. This equity is crucial in determining the user's share of rewards and penalties within the system.

            To encourage long-term staking, users who wish to withdraw their staked WBTC before the lock-up period ends will be subject to a 10% penalty on their initial staked amount.

            HORIZON aims to create a decentralized and equitable platform for all users, where financial rewards are distributed based on transparent and fair mechanisms. By offering a system where both penalties and project donations are redistributed, we ensure that every participant is rewarded for their long-term commitment and involvement in the ecosystem.
